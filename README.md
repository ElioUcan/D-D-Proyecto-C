Activity: AI Dungeon Master â€“ Text Adventure Game Engine

Objective:  Design and implement a simple text-based adventure game engine where the userâ€™s decisions determine the gameâ€™s outcome using conditional statements (if, else if, else, switch, etc.).

 Description:
You are tasked with creating the logic behind a text-based dungeon crawler game. The user will navigate through different rooms, choose actions, and encounter events such as traps, treasures, or monsters. Based on the player's input, the program must determine what happens next.

âœ… Requirements:
The game should include at least 3 decision points, each with multiple choices.

Each choice should lead to a different outcome using nested or chained conditionals.

There should be at least two win conditions and two lose conditions.

Implement at least one inventory check using a boolean or list and conditionals.

Use functions to organize parts of the game (optional but encouraged).

ðŸ“˜ Sample Scenario Flow:
You wake up in a dark dungeon. You see two doors: 1. Go through the left door. 2. Go through the right door. (If left) You enter a room with a sleeping dragon. What do you do? 1. Sneak past it. 2. Attack it. (If right) You find a chest. It's locked. 1. Try to pick the lock. 2. Leave it alone.
Each path leads to further decisions, and the outcomes depend on choices and possibly variables like hasKey = true or health = 0.

ðŸ“¦ Deliverable:
A fully working C code of the game.

Use of if, else, elif or switch statements to control game logic.

Clearly commented code.
